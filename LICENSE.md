### Quick Differences Between Licenses

Here’s a concise comparison to help you understand their differences:

- **MIT License**
  - **Type**: Permissive
  - **Key Feature**: Very simple; allows almost unrestricted use, including commercial applications.
  - **Requirement**: Keep the copyright and license notice.

- **Apache License 2.0**
  - **Type**: Permissive
  - **Key Feature**: Like MIT but adds a patent grant for protection against patent lawsuits.
  - **Requirement**: Include notice and state significant changes.

- **GNU GPL v3**
  - **Type**: Copyleft
  - **Key Feature**: Requires derivative works to also be open-source under GPL.
  - **Requirement**: Provide source code with any distribution.

- **BSD 2-Clause**
  - **Type**: Permissive
  - **Key Feature**: Similar to MIT but slightly more structured; no patent grant.
  - **Requirement**: Retain copyright and disclaimer.

- **MPL 2.0**
  - **Type**: Weak Copyleft
  - **Key Feature**: Modifications stay open-source, but can be combined with proprietary code.
  - **Requirement**: Share source code for MPL-covered parts.

### How to Choose the Best License

Selecting a license depends on your project’s goals:

- **If you want maximum freedom for users (including commercial use)**:
  - Choose **MIT** (simplest) or **Apache 2.0** (includes patent protection).

- **If you want all derivatives to remain open-source**:
  - Choose **GPL v3** to enforce open-source sharing.

- **If you want a balance between open-source and proprietary use**:
  - Choose **MPL 2.0** for flexibility in larger projects.

- **If you want a permissive license with minimal fuss**:
  - Choose **BSD 2-Clause** or **MIT**.

- **Additional Considerations**:
  - **Patents**: Use Apache 2.0 if your project might involve patentable technology.
  - **Community**: GPL fosters a strong open-source community; MIT/Apache attract broader adoption.
  - **Non-Software**: For documentation or creative works, consider Creative Commons (e.g., CC BY-SA), but these aren’t ideal for software.

For most software projects, **MIT** or **Apache 2.0** are great starting points due to their simplicity and widespread use. If you’re unsure, consult a legal expert, especially for commercial or complex projects.
